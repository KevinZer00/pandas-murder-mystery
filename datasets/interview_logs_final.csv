7,7,Did you ever stop and think how on Earth am I not a human? 
8,8,You believe in aliens? 
9,9,What! There's an alien in here? I want to go find it and talk to it! 
10,10,"Hey look, we're all just trying to get through the day."
11,11,It's been a long day.
12,12,I did not notice anything strange. 
13,13,Don't accuse me of being something I'm not. That's not cool.
14,14,Are you accusing me? 
15,15,Am I under arrest or am I free to go? 
16,16,Can I talk to my lawyer first? 
17,17,What is going on here? I thought we were all humans!
18,18,"Hey, I've got a stellar idea! How about you let me go back to work? "
19,19,I've got things to do!
20,20,I don't have time for this nonsense.

29,29,I'm just hungry right now. How much longer are we gonna talk? 
30,30,I did notice a person acting strange. I believe they're from Maintenance department.
31,31,Get outta here with that nonsense!
32,32,"Sorry, wrong person to ask. "
33,33,If there's an alien then we're all aliens. 
34,34,I don't know anything.
35,35,I just woke up! 
36,36,I've been busy at work all day. I didn't see anything.
37,37,"You're asking the wrong person, honestly. "
38,38,Can you just let me be? 
39,39,I don't like you. At all.
40,40,How dare you accuse me of something so stupid!
41,41,The person you're looking for was sending encrypted messages after leaving the Medbay.
42,42,This is stupid.
43,43,What a waste of time. 
44,44,You're making me uncomfortable now.
45,45,You're gonna make us all panic! 
46,46,Are you asking everybody this or just me?
47,47,What makes you think it's me? 
48,48,You're wasting my time here.
49,49,Why would you ask me that? Leave me alone.
50,50,I'm just waiting until my lunch break.
51,51,Do I need a lawyer or am I free to go?
52,52,This is so boring. 
53,53,Do you realize how crazy you sound? You sound like you forgot your meds! 
54,54,Leave me alone. I didn't do anything.
55,55,You're seriously asking the wrong person. Go ask someone else.
56,56,This is harassment. 
57,57,Is this recorded? Will what I say be used against me?
58,58,I plead the fifth. 
59,59,You don't think I'm a human? Just look at me!
60,60,I'm gonna quit!
61,61,Wrong person to ask. 
62,62,It's not me! It's the person with the broken leg limping around!
63,63,Did I do something wrong?
64,64,You wanna accuse me? Fine! Go right ahead. I hate it here anyways! 
65,65,I'm human! Go ask anybody else.
66,66,Are you off your meds? 
67,67,Get a load of this. Me? Really? 
68,68,Hahaha. Good joke. I'm gonna get back to work. 
69,69,It's not April Fool's today. 
70,70,"You're pulling my leg, aren't you? "
71,71,Don't you know to never accuse someone unless you have actual evidence? 
72,72,I don't know anything. 
73,73,"Just leave me alone, please. "
74,74,It's been a busy day at work and I just want to go take a nap. 
75,75,I wonder what they'll have for lunch today. Can I go now? 
76,76,"If I saw something, I would say something. "
77,77,Do you want to ask me again and see if I change my answer?
78,78,"If there was an HR, you'd be fired for saying such a thing!"
79,79,Think about what you just said and get back to me.
80,80,This is crazy. Seriously.
81,81,"I don't know anything, I just work here."
82,82,"Oh, give me a break. Ask someone else."
83,83,This place sucks! 
84,84,We're done here. I'm going back to my station.
85,85,"If I were an alien, I sure would not confess!"
86,86,Where's your evidence that I'm the culprit?
87,87,You got something smart you wanna tell me?
88,88,It could be anybody at this point! 
89,89,Are we doomed? I just got here!
90,90,I don't want any part of this. Don't question me anymore.
91,91,Please leave me alone. I'm busy.
92,92,"I'm not slacking off, you are! "
93,93,Am I in trouble or something?
94,94,You're either stupid or crazy if you think it's me.
95,95,I'm really busy today.
96,96,I'm hungry and tired. And bored.
97,97,My leg is broken and you're accusing me?
98,98,I think I'll call tomorrow off.
99,99,Is this on paid time?
100,100,I better get reimbursed with vacation hours for being questioned!
